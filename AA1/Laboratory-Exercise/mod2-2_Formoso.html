			<h1>Lycolis Recoil</h1>
			<p>
				For these peaceful days――there’s a secret behind it all.
			<br>
				A secret organization that prevents crimes: “DA - Direct Attack”.
				And their group of all-girl agents: “Lycoris”.
			<br>
				This peaceful everyday life is all thanks to these young girls.
			<br>
				The elite Chisato Nishikigi is the strongest Lycoris agent of all time.
				Alongside is Takina Inoue, the talented but mysterious Lycoris.
				They work together at one of its branches–Café LycoReco.
			<br>
				Here, the orders this café takes range from coffee and sweets to childcare, shopping, teaching Japanese to foreign students, etc.
				It's mostly tasks unbefitting of Lycoris.
			<br>
				The free-spirited and optimistic pacifist, Chisato.
				And the cool-headed and efficient Takina.
				The chaotic everyday lives of this mismatched duo begin!

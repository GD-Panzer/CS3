					<h2>Domination Victory</h2>
					<p>In vanilla and Gods & Kings, you achieve a domination victory if you are the last player in possession of your original capital. You do not have to wipe out all other players entirely! It doesn't matter who controls the other Capital Capitals: you can, for example, let another player take all the other Capital Capitals but yours and then take their Capital Capital, at which point you win immediately. Also, if two other players capture each other's original capitals, you will win the game even if you weren't at war with either of them.</p>

					<h2>Science Victory</h2>
					<p>To achieve a science victory, you must build and launch a spaceship. In order to do this, you need first to complete the Apollo Program project, and then you must reach far enough in the technology tree to be able to build the components of the spaceship. All of the necessary technologies for this are in the Information Era (Modern and Future Eras in vanilla), and require developing practically the entire tech tree.</p>

					<h2>Cultural Victory</h2>
					<p>Cultural victory is achieved by filling out five trees of social policies and completing the Utopia Project. Each tree has 5 policies, so in order to win you must have acquired 25 social policies in 5 different policy trees.</p>

					<h2>Diplomatic Victory</h2>
					<p>Diplomatic victory is achieved by winning a vote in the United Nations. To win the vote, you must have the majority vote, and in order to gather more votes, players can become allies with city-states, or return captured cities to defeated AI players.</p>

					<h2>Where to settle the capital</h2>
					<p>Personally, I like to settle the capital on a hill next to a river(ocean access optional). This is because the city gets more production due to being on a hill, getting a water wheel early game, and getting the dam late game.Also, since it's on a hill and next to a river, the city get's a bonus on defensive strength due to a opposing force get's a -attack mod due to crossing a river, and my city gets a +defensive strength due to being on a hill. Rivers also give extra food on farmland tiles adjacent to the river once you reaserch Civil Service, so the city's population can be increased much more rapidly for late game specialist buildings.</p>

					<h2>2nd And Consecutive City Settling</h2>
					<p>For your 2nd city, you should place the city either next to an ocean with a river(for that juicy late game 40 gold per trade route) or alternatively, place the city next to a mountain next to a river for some unique buildings and world wonders(like the observatory and Machu Picchu) which can help both science and faith production.</p>

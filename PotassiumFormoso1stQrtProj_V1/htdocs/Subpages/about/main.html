		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>Personally, I have played over 100 hours worth of civ 5, not that much considering some people go over 5 000 when playing civ, but still a lot of time and commitment towards it. I want to use it in some way to convince people to play games like civ (ie. Humankind, Age of Empires, etc.) because they are fun and quite addicting in a sense. I am not the best player all around, but I can certainly say that I have lots of expirence with this game and did lots of experimenting, so I made this.</p>
		<h1>My PsudoName (GD Panzer)</h1>
		<p>My Psudo-name was made quite embarassingly. I was quite attached to Geometry Dash, and wanted to make a yt channel. I looked at some of the most popular creators name's and I found a trend of placing 'GD' before an object, so 8 year-old me thought it was a good idea to place the german word for tank, Panzer, because it sounded cool. After that, it really just stuck, so I just kept it in the end.</p>
